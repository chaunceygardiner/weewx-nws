nws change history
------------------

4.2 07/03/2024
- Formatting changes on alerts tab.

4.1 06/27/2024
- Add nwsHeadline to alerts.
    ******* IMPORTANT, you must delete the existing nws database (nws.sdb) if        *******
    ******* udating versions earlier than 4.1.  Delete nws.sdb after installing the  *******
    ******* update and just before restaring weewx.  This is necessary because the   *******
    ******* database schema has changed.                                             *******

4.0 06/21/2024
- Add the following fields for one hour forecasts:
  pop (probabiliby of percipitation)
  dewpoint
  outHumidity (relative humidity)
    ******* IMPORTANT, you must delete the existing nws database (nws.sdb) if        *******
    ******* udating versions earlier than 4.0.  Delete nws.sdb after installing the  *******
    ******* update and just before restaring weewx.  This is necessary because the   *******
    ******* database schema has changed.                                             *******

3.2 06/20/2024
- Emergency fix for NWS screwup.  icon URLs are no longer full URLs.  NWS says they will
  patch.  This fix *should* work both ways as it checks first before prepending server.

3.1 06/12/2024
- Reduce default days of forecasts to keep to 9.  Add documenation that keeping a large
  numbr of days will slow down report generation.
- Note: This won't affect existing installations, but one can change days_to_keep to
  9 in the NWS section of weewx.conf.

3.0 06/04/2024
- Report range of windspeed for 12-hour forecasts.
  if NWS reports a range of windspeed, windSpeed2 will provide the upper range
  (i.e., windSpeed to windSpeed2).  If one wind speed is given, windSpeed2 will
  be None.  For 1-hour forecasts, windSpeed2 is always None.
    ******* IMPORTANT, you must delete the existing nws database (nws.sdb) if        *******
    ******* udating versions earlier than 3.0.  Delete nws.sdb after installing the  *******
    ******* update and just before restaring weewx.  This is necessary because the   *******
    ******* database schema has changed.                                             *******

2.3 03/01/2023
- Separate 1H, 12H and Alerts into separate threads.  Poll seconds and retry seconds
  for alerts are now configured separately from forecasts (because alerts need to
  be polled more often (600s polls and 30s retries are recommended for alerts).
- If zero alerts are downloaded (meaning no outstanding alerts), delete
  the existing alerts in the database.

2.2 02/27/2023
- Add more type information (especially return types) and fix up some minor errors.

2.1 12/28/2022
- Bug fix.  When NWS 12H and 1H forecasts are down for hours and hours (as happens),
  ALERTS aren't checked.  v2.1 fixes this oversight.

- Although not strictly necessary, you might want to change the following line in the
  NWS section of weewx.conf from 600 to 300.
  retry_wait_secs = 300

2.0.1 12/08/2022
- In sample report, separate, by a blank line, the
  What, Where, When, Impacts and Additional Details sections.

2.0 09/04/2022
1.  Better NWS alerts.

    Added the following new fields for alerts:
    id              : urn:oid:2.49.0.1.840.0.ba84e467a918f2f79303ebc47a234e87d285ab2f.003.1
    expires         : 2022-09-03 15:00:00 PDT (1662242400)
    sent            : 2022-09-03 05:37:00 PDT (1662208620)
    instructions    : Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay...
    status          : Actual
    messageType     : Update
    category        : Met
    severity        : Moderate
    certainty       : Likely
    urgency         : Expected
    sender          : w-nws.webmaster@noaa.gov
    senderName      : NWS San Francisco CA

    ******* IMPORTANT, you must delete the existing nws database (nws.sdb) if        *******
    ******* udating versions earlier than 2.0.  Delete nws.sdb after installing the  *******
    ******* update and just before restaring weewx.  This is necessary because the   *******
    ******* database schema has changed.                                             *******

    If you currently have a version of nws prior to 2.0, and you don't delete the existing nws
    database, nws will not work and the following will be in the log:
    ERROR user.nws: You must delete the nws.sdb database and restart weewx.  It contains an old schema!
    Note: there will also be other nws errors in the log.

1.13.1 09/02/2022
1. Alerts bug fix.

1.13 09/02/2022
1. Don't show alerts past their expiration time (this is in addition to not showing
   superseded alerts--which was fixed in v1.12).

1.12 08/31/2022
1. Properly implement ignoring expired alerts (this is a workaround due to an nws issue.
   The previous workaround was ignoring the new alert and keeping the expired alert!

1.11 06/11/2022
1. Added a standalone utility to test if NWS will return the correct forecast grid and,
   if it doesn't, figure out the correct grid and print the lines to add to the [NWS]
   section of weewx.conf so that the correct grid is used.
   Sample running of check_grid utility:
   $ ./check_grid.py --latitude 37.431495 --longitude -122.110937
   nws computed the incorrect grid(92, 88) for lat/long 37.431495/-122.110937

    Add the following two lines to the [NWS] section in weewx.conf:
        twelve_hour_forecast_url = "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/MTR/91,87/forecast"
        one_hour_forecast_url = "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/MTR/91,87/forecast/hourly"

1.10 04/25/2022
1. Emit error in log if returned NWS forecast is the wrong grid (due to a long standing NWS bug.
   If you see a message in the log such as:
   "WARNING user.nws: Lat/Long 37.431495/-122.110937 does not fall within bounds of forecast's polygon (due to NWS Bug)."
   your grid is off by (1,1).  In this example, you'll see in the log that the grid being called is 92,88.
       INFO user.nws: Downloading ForecastType.TWELVE_HOUR forecasts from https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/MTR/91,87/forecast.
       INFO user.nws: Downloading ForecastType.ONE_HOUR forecasts from https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/MTR/92,88/forecast/hourly.
   It should be 91,87.  As such, add the following lines to the NWS section of weewx.conf:
       twelve_hour_forecast_url = "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/MTR/91,87/forecast"
       one_hour_forecast_url = "https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/MTR/91,87/forecast/hourly"

1.9 02/11/2022
1. Fix errors if RsyncSpec section not specified in weewx.conf

1.8 02/01/2022
1. Hang on to Last-Modified header in response so it can be passed
   as If-Modified-Since header in request.  In this way, the server
   will return 304 (Not Mofified) if there isn't a new forecast.

1.7 01/28/2022
1. Revamped support for sharing forecasts between instances.

   a. Master weewx instances (i.e., instances of weewx that will
      query NWS for forecasts and distribute them), should add
      the following to the NWS section in weewx.conf:

   [NWS]
       .
       .
       .
       [[RsyncSpec]]
           enable = true
           remote_clients = <weewx-machine-1>, <weewx-machine-2>
           remote_user = root
           remote_dir = /root/forecasts
           compress = false
           log_success = false
           ssh_options = -o ConnectTimeout=1
           timeout = 1

   b. client weewx instances that will read forecast files distributed
      by the master (auto-magically via ssh), need to add the following
      to the NWS section of weewx.conf:

   [NWS]
       .
       .
       .
       read_from_dir = /root/forecasts

    c. passwordless ssh also needs to be setup between the master and the
       clients from the user on the master to the user specified by
       remote_user.  If you don't understand this, this feature is not for
       you.

1.6 01/23/2022
1. Support sharing forecasts between instances.  To accomplish this,
   a. for the "master" machine (i.e., the instance that will make
      forecasts available to share), add the following to the NWS
      section:
        forecasts_dir = <directory-to-write-TWELVE_HOUR-and-ONE_HOUR-forecasts>
   b. distribute the TWELVE_HOUR and ONE_HOUR files on your own (with rsync or scp commands in crontab)
   c. on the machines where the TWELVE_HOUR and ONE_HOUR files are distributed, add
      the following to the NWS section:
        read_twelve_hour_forecast_from_file = /<path>/TWELVE_HOUR
        read_one_hour_forecast_from_file = /<path>/ONE_HOUR
   With the above setup, only one instance (the master) will actually call nws.
   Note: It is not anticipated that this feature will be popular, as such, it is not described in the README.

1.5 12/14/2021
--------------
1. Guard against downloading forecasts with a generated time in the future.
   (Unfortunately, NWS is sometimes returning bogus generated times.)

1.4 11/23/2021
--------------
1. Allow twelve and one hour forecast URLs to be hardcoded
   (necessary since the NWS is returning the wrong grid for the author's lat/long)
   (Note: NWS has ackknowledged this bug and is working on a fix.)

1.3 03/15/2021
--------------
1. Fetch fresh URLs from NWS on every poll (just in case they ever change).

1.2 08/16/2020
--------------
1. Handle multiple simutaneous alerts.
   Regression caused by https://github.com/chaunceygardiner/weewx-nws/commit/1b11f462232066d8daae7cb7b890fd307601c069

1.1 07/22/2020
--------------
1. Handle case where 404/503 responses are not proper json.

1.0 05/30/2020
--------------
Initial release of NWS.

0.1 05/22/2020
--------------
Initial check-in.
